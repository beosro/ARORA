Autonomous Rover for Rapid Assistance 

Control a rover autonomously using python scripts and various sensors such as ultrasonic sensor, infrared sensors.etc. It also incorporates manual control via a custom developed mobile application along with live video streaming for visual assistance.

The commands generated from android application are send as signals to Raspberry pi which in turn controls the car. Raspberry pi sends the video streaming signals from an onboard camera back to the Android app.

 
Technologies used: Python, C++, Android, Java, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Wi-Fi communication and various sensors.
